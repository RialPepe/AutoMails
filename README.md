# AutoMails
"AutoMail" is a robust program designed in Python to automate the process of sending emails from a designated email address to all the email addresses within a specific database. What sets it apart is its Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed using Python's tkinter library, making interaction with the program extremely user-friendly.

To accomplish this task, I leveraged several Python libraries, including:

os for system operations.
pandas for efficient data handling.
smtplib for sending emails.
email.mime for creating email messages.
tkinter for building the graphical user interface.

The GUI allows for the customization of emails using data from the database, creating a highly customizable and efficient communication tool.
